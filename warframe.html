                <header>Upgrading and mastery</header>
                <p>In Warframe, upgrading refers to enhancing the capabilities of your Warframes, weapons, and gear to make them more powerful and effective in combat. Upgrading involves several key mechanics:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Modding: The primary method of upgrading in Warframe is through modding. Mods are cards that can be equipped to Warframes, weapons, and companions to enhance various attributes such as damage, critical chance, fire rate, and more. Mods can be obtained through gameplay, rewards, or trading with other players</li>
                   <li>Fusion: Mods can be upgraded through a process called fusion, which involves sacrificing duplicate or unwanted mods to increase the power level of a desired mod. Fusion increases the effectiveness of mods and unlocks additional upgrade ranks, providing greater bonuses.</li>
                   <li>Forma: Forma is a special resource used to polarize equipment slots, allowing players to further optimize their builds. When a slot is polarized, it becomes more efficient at accommodating specific mods of a matching polarity, enabling players to fit more powerful mods onto their equipment.</li>

                   <li>Orokin Catalysts and Reactors: Orokin Catalysts (for weapons) and Orokin Reactors (for Warframes and companions) are items that double the mod capacity of their respective equipment, allowing for more powerful builds with additional mods.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mastery in Warframe represents a measure of a player's overall progress and experience with the game. Mastery is gained by leveling up Warframes, weapons, companions, and Archwings to their maximum rank, known as Rank 30. Here are some key points about Mastery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Benefits of Mastery: Increasing Mastery Rank unlocks various benefits, including access to new weapons, Warframes, quests, and gameplay features. Higher Mastery Ranks also increase the daily standing limits for Syndicates and unlock additional loadout slots.</li>
                    <li>Ranking Up: As players level up equipment, they earn Mastery points based on the total number of unique items they have leveled. Once enough Mastery points are accumulated, players can undertake a Mastery Rank Test to advance to the next Mastery Rank. There are currently 30 Mastery Ranks in the game.</li>
                </ul>

Mods come in various types and rarities, each offering unique bonuses and effects. Here's an in-depth look at what mods are and how they function in Warframe:</p>
               <p>Mods can be obtained through various means in Warframe, including:</p>

                <li>Enemy Drops: Enemies can drop mods during missions. The rarity of the mod dropped depends on the difficulty and type of enemy.</li>
                <li>Rewards from Alerts and Events: Alerts, Invasions, and special events can offer mods as rewards for completing specific objectives.</li>
                <li>Transmutation: Players can use the Transmutation system to combine unwanted mods in hopes of obtaining rarer ones.</li>
                <li>Syndicates and Standing: Players can earn mods as rewards from Syndicates by increasing their standing with them.</li>

                <header>What weapons to work towards</header>
                <p>For new players in Warframe, focusing on obtaining versatile and effective weapons that are relatively easy to acquire and use is essential for progressing through the early game content. Here are some recommended weapons that new players can work towards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <Li>Hek (Shotgun): The Hek is a powerful shotgun that deals high damage per shot, making it effective against a variety of enemies encountered in the early game. It can be obtained by joining the Steel Meridian Syndicate or purchasing its blueprint from the in-game market.</Li>
                    <li>Atomos (Continuous Beam Pistol): The Atomos is a unique secondary weapon that fires a continuous beam of energy, making it ideal for dealing with groups of enemies. Its chaining effect allows it to hit multiple targets simultaneously, making it highly effective in crowd control situations. The Atomos blueprint can be obtained by completing the Jordas Golem Assassination mission on Eris.</li>
                    <li>Galatine (Heavy Blade): The Galatine is a powerful heavy blade melee weapon with high damage and wide-sweeping attacks. It's effective for cleaving through groups of enemies and can be obtained by joining the Steel Meridian Syndicate or purchasing its blueprint from the in-game market.</li>
                </ul>

                <header>How to make the premuim currency</header>
                <p>In Warframe, the premium currency, Platinum, can be obtained through various methods, both within the game and through trading with other players. Here are some ways to earn Platinum:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trading with Other Players: One of the most common ways to earn Platinum is by trading with other players. You can trade Prime parts, mods, blueprints, Ayatan sculptures, and other valuable items for Platinum with other players in the in-game Trading Post. Participating in the trading community can be lucrative, especially if you have rare or sought-after items.</li>
                    <li>Selling Prime Parts: Participate in Void Fissure missions to obtain Relics, which contain Prime parts and blueprints. Farm Prime parts by opening Relics in Void Fissure missions and then sell these parts in the Trading Post to other players for Platinum.</li>
                    <li>Selling Rare Mods: Farm rare mods from missions, events, or as rewards from bosses and sell them to other players for Platinum. Some mods, especially those with desirable effects or high rarity, can fetch a significant amount of Platinum.</li>
                    <li>Purchase Platinum: If you're willing to spend real money, you can purchase Platinum directly from the in-game Market or Warframe's official website. Keep an eye out for special discounts or promotions, such as bonus Platinum offers or discounted Platinum packs.</li>
